# Analysis Method Comparison

## 1. Was it challenging to produce identical results across methods?
Producing identical summary statistics (count, mean, min, max, std, unique counts, most frequent values) across pure Python, pandas, and polars required careful attention to edge cases (e.g., missing values, type inference, string/number handling). Pandas and polars provide built-in functions that are highly consistent, while pure Python requires more manual handling and is more error-prone, especially with large datasets or mixed types.

## 2. Which approach was easiest to implement and debug?
**Easiest:** Pandas. Its API is concise, well-documented, and provides one-liners for most summary statistics. Debugging is straightforward due to meaningful error messages and built-in data inspection tools.

Polars is also easy to use and very fast, but its syntax is less familiar to most analysts. Pure Python is the hardest: it requires manual iteration, type checks, and custom logic for missing values and statistics.

## 3. Which approach performed best (speed/memory)?
**Best performance:** Polars. It is designed for high performance and low memory usage, especially on large datasets. Pandas is slower and more memory-intensive, but still practical for moderate-sized data. Pure Python is slowest and uses the most memory for large files, as it lacks optimized vectorized operations.

## 4. What would you recommend to a junior data analyst?
Start with pandas for its simplicity, documentation, and ecosystem. Move to polars if you hit performance bottlenecks or work with very large data. Use pure Python only for learning or if dependencies are restricted.

## 5. How do AI coding tools handle these different approaches?
AI coding tools (like Cascade, Copilot, ChatGPT) excel at generating pandas and polars code, as these libraries have clear APIs and documentation. They can generate pure Python code, but are more likely to introduce subtle bugs or inefficiencies due to the need for manual logic. AI tools are best used to scaffold code in pandas/polars, and for pure Python, should be checked carefully.

## 6. Specific challenges encountered and how they were solved
- **Pure Python:** Handling missing values, type inference, and efficient statistics required custom code. Used `math` for std, `Counter` for value counts, and careful iteration for groupings.
- **Pandas:** Ensuring consistent treatment of NaNs and categorical types. Used `dropna()`, `value_counts()`, and `groupby()` for grouping.
- **Polars:** Syntax differences and data type handling. Used `.drop_nulls()`, `.value_counts()`, and `.groupby()`.
- **General:** Ensured all scripts print the same statistics, even when columns are all-NaN or non-numeric.
